Generated a corpus of 2.5 million tokens from scientific articles which were collected using Microsoft Researchâ€™s Academic Search API. Employed Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods such as tokenization, thresholding, and tagging to construct the corpus, which was used with PyTorch to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
